# Over-Tunnling
Tap network tunnel implemented using shared folders between two machines. For this to work, the sharing mechanism must allow for read and write by both machines. 

# Motivation
I found this useful, when working on a resitricted environement. The two machines could be VMs but the networking betweeen them is disabled. However, the network admin believe it is a great and safe idea to allow shared folders between the two machines.
